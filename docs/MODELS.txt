Surgeo model classes exist to provide a user-friendly means of loading and
using algorithms. For signatures, please see the docstrings themseleves. This
is simply a general primer.

A model should institute the following methods:

    build_up (optional)
        Does model setup at the enf of instantiation.
        
    db_check
        Returns True if the database is properly set up in the surgeo.sqlite
        database. Returns False if database is not properly set up.
        
    db_create
        This method creates the database table in the surgeo.sqlite database.
        As a convention, tables should be have the model name first and a 
        table name joined with an underscore (e.g. GeocodeModel has a table
        called 'geocode_joint'). Ideally the data should be availible from
        public sources. Put temp files in the temp folder.

    db_destroy
        Destroys the tables created in db_create.

    get_result_object
        First composes a dictionary object. It takes the dictionary and 
        provides an object with attributes as a result. 
        get_result_object({'white_probability': .95} creates a result object 
        with a white_probability attribute of .95. For example:
        print(result.white_probability) gives us .95.
        
    csv_summary
        Summarizes a csv (typically via weighted mean). It is typically much
        easier to write a simple wrapper aroud the BaseModel's csv_summary
        method via super().csv_summary().

    csv_process
        This takes a csv and runs the model on the appropriate elements,
        appending the output to a new csv.

    temp_cleanup (optional)
        The default method will typically suffice. It just removes everything
        in the temp folder.
