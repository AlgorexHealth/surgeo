There are a variety of mechanisms by which one can impute race based on
generally available characteristics. Three popular approaches are
surname-based (last name), forename-based (first name), and location-based.

The surname-based approach works because certain last names are found much
more often in specific racial/ethnic groups. For example, over 90% of people
with the surname "Hernandez" identify as Hispanic according to Census data.
Similarly, over 90% of those with the last name of "Yoo" identify as Asian
or Pacific Islander.

The forename-based approach works similarly to the surname-based approach,
with first name being used as the proxy for racial/ethnic probability.

The location-based approach works because racial/ethnic groups often live
in similar areas. For example, roughly 75% of Americans living in the U.S.
Virgin Islands are Black. Similarly, Vermont is approximately 95% White.

These approaches all have their strengths and weaknesses. Surname-based
approaches are excellent at picking out Hispanic and Asian/Pacific
Islander surnames. Surname-based approaches are comparatively weaker when
trying to identify Blacks, Whites, and Native Americans by name.
Forename-based approaches compensate for weaknesses in the surname-only
approach [#]_. Location-based approaches are much better at discerning
Black from White areas, but are not particularly good at separating Asian
and Hispanic populations [#]_.

It is possible to combine these approaches using `Bayesian inference`_;
this provides result that is superior to using any approach alone [#]_.
For a combination of surname-based and location-based, for example, this
can be performed as follows.

First one takes the probability of race given a particular surname
(prior probability) and then multipies it by ratio of the population in a
particular geographical area given that race. The result is an updated
(posterior) probability of race given a particular surname and a particular
geographic area. This can be further refined with the addition of forename
data.

For additional detail on how this works, please see `BISG by Example`_.
