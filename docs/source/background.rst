Background
----------

There are a variety of mechanisms by which one can impute race based one
generally available characaristics. Two popular approaches are
surname-based and location-based.

The surname-based approach works because certain last names are found much
more often in certain racial/ethnic groups. For example, over 90% of people
with the surname "Hernandez" identify as Hispanic according to Census data.
Similarly, over 90 of those with the last name of "Yoo" identify as Asian
or Pacific Islander.

The location-based approach works because racial/ethnic groups often live
in similar areas. For example, roughly 75% of Americans living in the U.S.
Virgin Islands are Black. Similarly, Vermont is approximately 95% White.

These approaches both have their strengths and weaknesses. Surname-based
approachses are excellent at picking out Hispanic and Asian/Pacific
Islander surnames. Surname-based approaches are comparatively weaker when
trying to Blacks, Whites, and Native Americans by name. Location-based
approaches are much better at discerning Black from White areas, but are
not particularly good at separating Asian and Hispanic populations.

    ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are not identical to ZIP codes.
    Because ZIP codes change from year-to-year, the Census Bureau uses
    what it calls ZCTAs. These ZCTAs are rough approximations of the ZIP
    code geographic area--but it remains static after being created.
