###############################################################################

On September 18, 2014, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) 
released a whitepaper entitled, "Using Publicly Available Information to Proxy 
For Unidentified Race and Ethnicity". Link here (current as of September 19, 
2014):

http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201409_cfpb_report_proxy-methodology.pdf

The whitepaper detailed the CFPB's use of Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding 
(BISG) analysis for analyzing disparate impact discrimination under the Equal 
Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA). BISG analysis allows for the determination of 
race through the use of proxy information (such as surname and geographical 
information). The CFPB's BISG model is based off of a 2009 study, "Using the 
Census Bureau's Surname List to Improve Estimates of Race/Ethnicity and 
Associated Disparities", which was published in the Journal of Health Services 
and Outcomes Research Methodology v. 9, no. 2, June 2009, p. 69-83. A copy of 
this study may be purchased here:

At the same time the whitepaper was released, the CFPB released a reference 
model which it claims to use for its analysis. The model is writen in STATA 12 
and requires geocode pre-formatted data. The model can be found here:

Surgeo is an MIT-licensed tool for quickly analyzing datasets and then 
providing a preliminary indication as to whether disparate impact 
discrimination may exist. It uses publically availible data and can be run 
using free and open source components.

Model
###############################################################################

The model upon which this software is based was created by Mark N. Elliot et 
al. in the article "Using the Census Bureau's surname list to improve 
estimates of race/ethnicity and associated disparities".

Where k is census block
Where j is surname
Where i is race (1 = Hispanic, 
                 2 = White, 
                 3 = Black, 
                 4 = Asian or Pacific Islander, 
                 5 = American Indian / Alaska Native, 
                 6 = Multiracial)

Where u(i,j,k) = p(i|j) * r(k|i):

                                      u(i,j,k)
q(i|j,k) = ---------------------------------------------------------------
           u(1,j,k) + u(2,j,k) + u(3,j,k) + u(4,j,k) + u(5,j,k) + u(6,j,k)

Geocode data comes from racial proportions in SF1 file.

# TODO

Listed surnames come from file giving proportions for all names (count >= 100)
Unlisted surnames are excluded.

Surname file:

This is where the surname information is pulled from.

Note: Hispanic or latino is defined as an ethnicity, rather than a race. An 
individual can therefore be "White" or "Hispanic or Latino White" for example.
Since we are incuding hispanic as a race, we define the races as following:
